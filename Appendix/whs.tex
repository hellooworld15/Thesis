\chapter{Work Health and Safety}
\label{app:whs}


Work Health and Safety is a significant concern to all workers. Although seemingly simple in nature and low in risk, office jobs have their fair share of long-term health risks that must be considered. This section will analyse a number of Work Health and Safety concerns in the modern office that applies to this ESIPS placement at Accenture. Some that will be discussed include physical health, COVID-19, and mental health.

\section{Physical Health}
In a standard office, work is often long, repetitive, and stationary. Bad posture, uncomfortable chairs, mispositioned monitors, wrist strain over cramped keyboards, poor lighting or glare are just a few of the most common risks and hazards to physical health. 

At Accenture and home, the following precautions were observed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Education on the proper position to work in was studied from \ref{fig:posture_desk}. Notably, the height of the chair is set to the appropriate height to allow feet to rest in an almost \SI{90}{\deg} angle, the top of the monitor edge at eye level, and the monitor slightly tilted up to equalise the distance to all corners of the screen. 
  \item Good chairs were selected. I purchased a Herman Miller Aeron chair for work at home, known for its world-renowned ergonomics. 
  \item Used a second external monitor to relieve neck strain, as it is possible to adjust the monitor's position to the optimal position. This also provided a significant productivity boost. The brightness was also adequately adjusted to bring the most comfort to the eyes. 
  \item A standing desk was purchased for working at home. 
  \item Regular breaks were taken with the team during the time at the office. 
  \item An ergonomic keyboard, the Kinesis Advantage 2, was used to relieve wrist strain and improve productivity with the features such as macros. 
\end{enumerate}

Although there are many sources of long-term physical issues, these can be easily managed with awareness and mitigated effectively, resulting in a low level of risk. 

\section{Covid-19 precautions}
Covid-19 has undeniably impacted the world in many ways. This highly infectious disease caused major lockdowns and shifted work from the office to the home for extended periods. In order to follow national and state requirements, Accenture and employees worked remotely and suspended office visits. Return to the office was first announced in mid-November, where a number of precautions were followed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All state and national requirements were followed, including masks in public indoor areas and on transport, QR code check-ins in all locations required, and mandatory bookings for visits to the office.
  \item Social distancing in all public areas. 
  \item Sanitising hands on every entry to the office.
  \item Disallowing guest visits to the office. 
\end{enumerate}

Although the severity of symptoms one suffers from contracting Covid-19 vary wildly in the younger age group, the potential to be sick for a week or more, in addition to the mandatory self-isolation period, is highly disruptive to work and the greater population. As such, the threat of Covid-19 results in high risk. 


\section{Mental health}
Mental health is an often under-looked part of one's health. It varies greatly from person to person, and many factors play into one's overall mental health, including social health, work-life balance, and financial status. Without careful consideration, planning and awareness of one's mental health, the employee's productivity may drop sharply. 

A number of precautions were taken to care for my mental health:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ensuring I was enjoying the work I was doing. I transferred internally between teams to find more exciting work that I could grow and learn in while also finding a more relevant thesis topic aligned with my interests. 
  \item Coming into the office when practical. Although there were many days where I was the only team member in the office, being able to experience the office, grab hot drinks in the morning with colleagues, and work in an environment separate from home was very beneficial.
  \item Preventing work hours from extending into my personal time too often. 
\end{enumerate}

Mental health is a complex risk to quantify since it is difficult to measure and includes many factors. Overall the onus is mainly on the employee to ensure they take the proper precautions and use the available resources such as sick leave or personal time off. Particularly with the challenging program that is ESIPS, this risk is categorised as a moderate risk.

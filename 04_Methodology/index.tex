\chapter{Theory and Methodology}
This chapter outlines the theory and Methodology used to create, test and collect the data required for the wing-propeller interaction analysis. 
\section{Material Choice}
In order to readily edit and modify the model to be tested, 3D printing was used to print the final developed model. 3D printing has become increasingly common when developing models testing in wind tunnels. Polylactic acid (PLA) filament was used to print the main body of the model as this is the most widely used and available filament for 3D printing purposes. PLA has a low melting point of $\approx$ 150 $^{\circ}$, good layer adhesion and structural strength. PLA can also be extruded in a variety of ways in order to develop different textures on the surface of the 3D model. This is particularly significant for MAVs as aircraft surfaces are typically smooth to reduce viscous drag effects. 3D printed models may have thin ridges between layers when printed, however, the extrusion rate, nozzle size, temperature, and bed temperature can all be set to mitigate this issue as much as possible. For the wings and tail however a lightweight PLA was used in order to print a smoother surface. This is particularly important for the wings and tail as these are the main surfaces which provide lift for the aircraft. By using a lighterweight PLA, the structure also allows for some bending as seen in typical wing shapes, rather than printing with normal PLA to produce a rigid structure.  


\section{FreeCAD}
FreeCAD is a 3D parametric modeler and was used with python scripts provided by Dries Verstraete to produce fuselage, wing and tail shapes when given input parameters to define the shape and geometry. Various model shapes were produced with the aim of making the model 3D printable in order to allow for ease of manufacturing and testing. Several design constraints had to be considered when developing the model due to the structural strength of the PLA used for 3D-printing and the limitations. The wings and tail could not be too small in order to print the aerofoil shape accurately.\\
\\ The TL54 airfoil was used for the main wings due to this airfoil having a high lift coefficient and low pitching moment. The wingspan and chord length were 855mm and 180mm respectively for the model. The fuselage was designed to be 600mm and a V-tail which had a maximum chord, minimum chord and span of 105mm, 55mm and 145mm respectively was used.

The model shown in Figure \ref{fig:freeCADModel} was also fitted to mount into the 3x4 wind tunnel for testing as shown in Figure \ref{fig:modelWithTunnel}

\end{figure}

The model size was also chosen in order to reduce the blockage that will be experienced when using the model during wind tunnel testing. The blockage varied from 4.9\% to 8.7\% for an angle of attack range from -5$^\circ$ to 15$^\circ$. The wing span was also limited in size in order to ensure that wind tunnel interference would not influence the results. 

\section{VAP 3.5}
VAP 3.5 is a open-source software which uses the High-Order Free Wake (HOFW) \todo{abb} method in order to determine the aerodynamic performace of MAV designs. \\

The HOFW method was developed to allow for the computation of propeller-wing system interactions. This is made possible by sing higher-order vorticity elements to represent the wings and propeller blads as lifting surfaces. Higher order elements provide a higher force resolution and are more computationally stable wakes than the alternative vortex-lattice method. The HOFW method is able to maintain similar ease of geometric presentation which is seen in VLM. 

The HOFW method


\section{XFOIL}
XFOIL is another open source free to use software which has been developed by Harold Youngren and Mark Drela. The software is used to analyse 2D airfoils for their aerodynamic characteristics. XFOIL was used to produce aerofoil data which accounted for viscous effects. It is essential that the software account for the viscous effects as this has an essential role in the flow characteristics accross the surface of an aircraft wing. XFOIL accounts for the viscous effects which are particularly seen at lower Reynolds numbers, by using the wake momentum thickness to determine the skin friction produced as fluid passes over the surface of the airfoil as given by Equation \ref{eqn:XFOIL}. 


\begin{equation}
    \theta = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{u}{U_e} ( 1 - \frac{u}{U_e) } \,dy
    \label{eqn:XFOIL}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta$ is the momentum thickness at a given point along the airfoil
    \item $U_e$ is the freestream velocity 
    \item u is the flow velocity at a position y distance from the airfoil surface
\end{itemize}

In this manner the skin friction losses can be determined and accounted for when running the VAP software to analyse the stability of the model. 


\section{Wind Tunnel Testing}
In order to analyse the stability of the final developed model in the three configurations, the model was mounted in the wind tunnel to determine the forces and moments acting at several conditions in order to assess the effect that adding a propeller has on the stability of the model


\subsection{Wind Tunnel Setup}

Wind tunnel tests were taken for several variations of Aoa, airspeed, propeller speed and configuration. These are outlined below

\begin{itemize}
    \item Aoa: -5 $^{\circ}$ to 15 $^{\circ}$ in increments of 2$^{\circ}$
    \item Airspeed: 10m/s, 15m/s and 20m/s
    \item Motor speed: 6000RPM, 9000RPM, 11000RPM
    \item Configuration: No propeller, tractor and pusher
\end{itemize}

A safety net was placed in the wind tunnel in case any parts of the model were unable to remain attached as the airspeed increased to 20m/s as shown in Figure \ref{fig:windTunnelNet}. An external cooler was used to ensure that the wind tunnel engine itself did not overheat and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:engineCooler}.

The nano25 load cell was used to record the forces and moments acting on the model about the mounting position at 25$\overline{c}$ and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:LoadCella}. The model mount was then attached over the load cell as shown in Figure \ref{fig:LoadCellb}

The model was then attached in three main configurations. These were mounting the propeller without a propeller, in a tractor and pusher configurations.

        \label{fig:typesUsed}
\end{figure}

The wind tunnel was then callibrated for wind speed, atmospheric conditions and angles of attack. The mount used for the model was double checked using a pitch gauge to ensure the angle of attack was correct.

\end{figure}

When using the prop the motor was supplied with a 7.4V battery and the RPM was set to $\approx 6000 RPM$, $\approx 9000RPM$ and $\approx 11000 RPM$. The bias at each airspeed tested was first calculated in order to determine the change in forces and moments across the angles of attack tested. The yawing 


\section{Stability Calculation}
In order to determine the stability of the model in all the tested configurations the stability deratives of the model had to be determined. Data from the nano 25 load cell was used to determine the loads and moments acting on the model about the mounting point. These values were transformed \todo{right word?} to the neutral point of the model at 20$\overline{c}$. The aerodynamic coefficients were determined using equations \ref{eqn:lift} to \ref{eqn:drag} and the moment coefficients about the pitch, yaw and roll axis were calculated using Equations \ref{eqn:pitching} to \ref{eqn:yaw}.

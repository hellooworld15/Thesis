\chapter{Background} 
This section outlines the core theory and topics which are relevant for the optimization of MAV's and the effect of propeller interactions on the main wings of small MAV. 




\section{Low Reynolds Number Effects }
\label{sec:LowReynolds}
Low Reynolds number compressible aerodynamics affect many different varities of aircraft. Aircraft used to survey martian terrian and MAV's are particularly influenced due to the change in atmosphere and small geometry respectively\cite{Munday2015}. This especially critical for propeller based systems as the root and tip of the mach numbers can vary significantly\cite{Munday2015}. Typically aircraft fly at high Reynolds numbers (>$10^{6}$), MAV's however generally fly between ($10^{4} and 10^{5}$) \cite{Winslow2018}.

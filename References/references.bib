In this strategy, after defining flight mission, the weight of the micro air vehicle is estimated and then, aerodynamic parameters and thrust force are calculated. In the next step, some different plan-forms and airfoils are investigated to be selected for decreasing the stall region in high attack anglesby open source software named XFLR5. Having calculated the aerodynamic center, the pitching moment needed to stabilize the micro air vehicle is computed. Due to the static margin, the airfoil camber line is changed to stabilize the micro air vehicle and then, its thickness is improved to reach to a high aerodynamic characteristic. To evaluate the software results, some flight tests are performed which then compared to the software results that show a good agreement. Finally, some adjustments and improvements are made on the micro air vehicle and then, its performance is obtained by the flight tests. The flight test results show it has an excellent aerodynamic performance, stability and maneuverability.},

Based on this idea, different aerodyne models were developed by various research groups, with a wide range of applicability, being used for: research/education, surveying and real-time data transmission in the field of military or civilian, mapping inaccessible areas, application in meteorology, monitoring animals in their habitat, testing aircraft prototypes in hazardous environments, entertainment, etc. In this paper, a survey of the designs of unmanned aerial vehicles, based on Coandă effect, will be presented and discussed.},

This study's primary objective is to present the effect of the interactions between a low aspect ratio wing and propeller for a range of incidence in transition between horizontal and vertical flight. During the transition from horizontal flight to vertical flight or vice versa, the flow patterns seen by the wing are the result of the combination between the free-stream and the propeller flow. This was reflected in the change of the aerodynamic forces and moments of the wing. The model is a tractor configuration propeller and with a wing of aspect ratio equal to one, the airfoil of the wing is a NACA 0012. All tests were conducted at low speeds in a range from 2 to 8 m/s. In order to simulate the transition flight of a tilt-body MAV VTOL a range of incidence from-10 to 90 degrees was used. The results show that the flow of the propeller certainly improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, increasing the lift and delaying stall with respect to the flight path of the MAV.},

The method was implemented in a computer program which enables the user to find the optimum lift distribution for minimum drag for any tractor propeller/wing arrangement of arbitrary shape.

  abstract = {Airfoil selection procedure, wind tunnel testing and an implementation of 6-DOF model on flying wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) has been proposed in this research. The selection procedure of airfoil has been developed by considering parameters related to aerodynamic efficiency and flight stability. Airfoil aerodynamic parameters have been calculated using a potential flow solver for ten candidate airfoils. Eppler-387 proved to be the most efficient reflexed airfoil and therefore was selected for fabrication and further flight testing of vehicle. Elevon control surfaces have been designed and evaluated for longitudinal and lateral control. The vehicle was fabricated using hot wire machine with EPP styrofoam of density 50 Kg/m3. Static aerodynamic coefficients were evaluated using wind tunnel tests conducted at cruise velocity of 20 m/s for varying angles of attack. Rate derivatives and elevon control derivatives have also been calculated. Equations of motion for FWMAV have been written in a body axis system yielding a 6-DOF model. It was found during flight tests that vehicle conducted coordinated turns with no appreciable adverse yaw. Since FWMAV was not designed with a vertical stabilizer and rudder control surface, directional stability was therefore augmented through winglets and high wing leading edge sweep. Major problems encountered during flight tests were related to left rolling tendency. The left roll tendency was found inherent to clockwise rotating propeller as 'P' factor, gyroscopic precession, torque effect and spiraling slipstream. To achieve successful flights, many actions were required including removal of excessive play from elevon control rods, active actuation of control surfaces, enhanced launch speed during take off, and increased throttle control during initial phase of flight. FWMAV flew many successful stable flights in which intended mission profile was accomplished, thereby validating the proposed airfoil selection procedure, modeling technique and proposed design.},

First, a multi-objective optimization model of planning UAV route for road segment surveillance was proposed, which aimed to minimize UAV cruise distance and minimize the number of UAVs used. Then, an evolutionary algorithm based on Pareto optimality technique was proposed to solve multi-objective UAV route planning problem. At last, a UAV flight experiment was conducted to test UAV route planning effect, and a case with three scenarios was studied to analyze the impact of different road segment lengths on UAV route planning. The case results show that the optimized cruise distance and the number of UAVs used decrease by an average of 38.43\% and 33.33\%, respectively. Additionally, shortening or extending the length of road segments has different impacts on UAV route planning.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address a preliminary assessment of the performance effects of swirl recovery vanes (SRVs) in a installed and uninstalled tractor propeller arrangement. A numerical analysis was performed on a propeller and a propeller-wing configuration after the SRVs were optimized first in a separate process. The SRVs are essentially designed to recover the swirl in the rotor slipstream, thereby increasing the propulsive efficiency. To confirm the main flow effects of the SRVs, a separate windtunnel study was performed on a single-rotating propeller model in the large low-speed windtunnel. A steady RANS-based numerical analysis showed that the application of SRVs in a propeller-only model may lead to an increase of propulsive efficiency in the order of 2 \%. In case of the SRVs in a representative tractor propeller-wing configuration, the positive effects are reduced due to the swirl recovery effect of the wing and the upwash effect in the SRV plane. The latter requires an optimization per SRV blade which was not performed in this particular study. In de experimental study performance data of the propeller were acquired with a rotating shaft balance. Furthermore, Particle Image Velocimetry PIV measurements in the slip-stream of the propeller with and without SRVs substantiated the efficacy of the vanes in reducing the swirl in the propeller slipstream. Reductions of 50\% in the swirl kinetic energy was observed at a medium thrust settings.},

  abstract = {Major challenges to low speed microflight are the transient and time-averaged velocities arising from the atmospheric boundary layer, particularly turbulence a few meters above the ground. In this paper, prior work on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer close to the ground, and the relative turbulence as perceived by a moving craft, are considered. New measurements are described that document the time-averaged and transient velocities at a height of 4 m above the ground. These were made using a bank of four multihole pressure probes laterally separated by 150 and 50 mm on a mast above a test car. Transient flow pitch angles were investigated and it was found that the overall variation with lateral separation decreased relatively slowly with reducing separation, but that both this and the pitch angle coherence may be described nondimensionally. As the slow decrease in pitch variation with lateral spacing implies that the roll inputs arising from vertical fluctuations would increase with reducing span, it is speculated that increasingly active and authoritative control systems are required.

  abstract = {A computational study has been conducted on various airfoils to simulate flows at Reynolds numbers (Re) primarily between 104 and 105 to provide understanding and guidance for MAV and other low-Reynolds-number designs. The computational fluid dynamics tool used in this study is a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and a correlation-based laminar–turbulent boundary-layer transition model. The airfoils investigated in this study include NACA 0009, NACA 0012 (conventional and reversed configuration), Clark-Y, flat plate airfoils (1, 3, and 5\% thickness), and thin cambered plates (3, 6, and 9\% camber). Airfoils were examined for lift and drag performance as well as surface pressure and flow field characteristics. In general, it is observed that below the Reynolds number of 106, lift and drag characteristics for most airfoils cannot be assumed to be constant with the Reynolds number. Below the Reynolds number of 105, cambered plate airfoils are shown to have better lift and drag characteristics than thick conventional airfoils with rounded-leading edges. Flat plate performance is generally invariant to the Reynolds number, but performance improves as thickness is decreased for a given Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {The establishment of the Aircraft Dynamic Model (ADM) constitutes the prerequisite for the design of the navigation and control system, but the aerodynamic parameters in the model could not be readily obtained especially for small-scaled fixed-wing UAVs. In this paper, the procedure of computing the aerodynamic parameters is developed. All the longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic derivatives are firstly calculated through semi-empirical method based on the aerodynamics, rather than the wind tunnel tests or fluid dynamics software analysis. Secondly, the residuals of each derivative are proposed to be identified or estimated further via Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), with the observations of the attitude and velocity from the airborne integrated navigation system. Meanwhile, the observability of the targeted parameters is analyzed and strengthened through multiple maneuvers. Based on a small-scaled fixed-wing aircraft driven by propeller, the airborne sensors are chosen and the model of the actuators are constructed. Then, real flight tests are implemented to verify the calculation and identification process. Test results tell the rationality of the semi-empirical method and show the improvement of accuracy of ADM after the compensation of the parameters.},

  abstract = {A numerical method is described for the calculation of the distributed and total aerodynamic characteristics of a thin wing of any planform. We use only the generally accepted hypotheses-smoothness of flow around the wing and the Chaplygin-Zhukovskii condition of finite velocity at the trailing edges. The medium is considered ideal and incompressible. The development of a nonlinear theory for the wing of small aspect ratio in a compressible medium is one of the most important and difficult problems of wing theory. It has long attracted the attention of the aerodynamiscists. Chaplygin touched on this question in his 1913 report “On the vortex theory of the finite span wing”, presented to the Moscow Mathematical Society. Several interesting ideas and schemes were proposed by Golubev (see, for example, [2]). The first adequately correct and effective attempt to determine theoretically the nonlinear variation of wing normal force with angle of attack was that of Bollay [3]. In this work he studied rectangular wings of very small aspect ratio. The circulation variation law along the span was taken to be constant, and along the chord it was taken the same as for a flat plate of infinite span. It was also assumed that the centerlines of the free vortices trailing from the wing tips are straight lines and form the same angle with the plane of the wing. The magnitude of this angle was calculated from the average value of the relative velocity. The boundary condition at the wing was satisfied at a single point. In several later studies [4–8] attempts have been made to extend this approach somewhat. In [7] the circulation variation law along the wing chord is calculated, and the boundary conditions are satisfied more exactly. However, attempts to convert to the study of wings of more complex planform, when the circulation can no longer be considered constant along the span, are hydrodynamically incorrect [5, 6, 8]. In these studies schemes are used in which with smooth flow around the wing the free vortices stand off from the wing surface. The angles which the vortex centerlines form with the wing surface are assumed or are calculated on the basis of very arbitrary hypotheses. In the present paper the vortex layer which simulates the wing surface, just as in the linear theory [9, 10], is replaced by a system of discrete vortices. The free vortices away from the wing then are discrete curvilinear vortex filaments. Each of them is replaced by a series of rectilinear vortex segments. The number of bound and free discrete vortices may be increased without limit. The position of the free vortex segments is determined in the computation process, which is carried out sequentially for a series of angles of attack α, beginning with α→0 when the linear theory scheme holds. We note that the question of accounting for the effect of the leading-edge free vortex sheet is not considered here, although the method described may also be used to obtain results for this problem. The proposed method turned out to be very general, flexible and convenient for the digital computer. It permits studying the practical convergence of the solution, and also permits obtaining not only the total and distributed characteristics of the wing of arbitrary planform, but also studying such delicate questions as the rollup of the vortex sheet behind the wing.},

  abstract = {The conceptual design and optimization of a tilt-rotor Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) for a well-defined mission are performed. The objective of this design cycle is to decrease the design time in order to efficiently create a functional tilt-rotor drone. A flight mission is firstly defined for a tilt-rotor MAV performing hovering and cruise flight scenarios. Secondly, a complex wing shape is chosen and modeled in order to determine the final shape. The initial shape is scaled in order to acquire an arbitrary wingspan of one meter. For the specific area and wingspan, the aspect ratio of the designed wing shape is found to be equal to 2.32. Thirdly, a constraint analysis of the MAV is performed by using an energy balance analysis for six different flight scenarios. This analysis yields the required power loading and wing loading. Fourthly, the weight of the vehicle is estimated using both statistical and computational methods. After estimating the total weight and the wing loading of the MAV, the surface of the wing is determined, yielding a final wingspan of 0.76 m. Subsequently, considering the total weight of the designed MAV, the needed lift coefficient is determined. Fifthly, using the lift coefficient in conjunction with XLFR5, a batch of airfoils is selected and analyzed to evaluate the aerodynamic coefficients of the wing with each airfoil. This analysis ultimately leads to the optimum airfoil being selected. Finally, design of the fuselage and tail, internal components selection, and servo-mechanisms design are carried out prior to a stability analysis. All these proposed steps are needed to design efficient and functional tilt-rotor MAVs.},

Micro aerial vehicles are very small, have a wingspan of about 100-150 mm, and operate at relatively low Reynolds numbers. A precision aerodynamic balance was designed in order to measure the lift, drag, rolling-moment, and pitching-moment of micro air vehicles, as these parameters are too small to be determined by general-purpose aerodynamic measurement systems. During the design process, the aerodynamic balance was analyzed with the finite-element method in order to produce an optimal design and was calibrated as well. The calibration results and the finite element analysis results were compared and found to be in good agreement and the final design was determined to be acceptable. In addition, a computer-based data acquisition system has been developed to acquire measurement data from the aerodynamic balance. Wind tunnel tests of a 2D airfoil were performed to validate the aerodynamic measurement system. Results of the wind tunnel tests were compared with references and found to be in good agreement. Finally, we measured aerodynamic characteristics of MAV wing model used in Batwing with the developed aerodynamic measurement system. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the design process of a fixed-wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) is presented. The design cycle begins with mission requirements, followed by collecting statistical data from available MAVs. Next, MAV's sizing and weight estimation are conducted based on mission requirements. Finally, the aspect ratio, taper ratio, and airfoil selection are performed. As the MAV has a low aspect ratio and low Reynolds number airflow, the aerodynamics is not fully understood. The propeller wash increases the complexity of the aerodynamic flow; therefore, the MAV is manufactured for wind tunnel testing. The absent of actual flight performance and flight dynamics of fixed-wing MAVs are the main driven factors for this research. The wind tunnel experimental data are used in the flight performance equations to evaluate the MAV's actual flight performance and compare it with the estimated values. As MAV is very sensitive to the external disturbances which make the prediction of its dynamics a hard task, a nonlinear flight simulation model is created for the MAV's dynamics prediction. This model uses the experimentally measured data to predict the MAV's dynamics and its stability against wind disturbances. The results in this paper indicate that using aerodynamics historical data will give a huge error in estimating MAV's flight performance. The measured data in this research can be used to eliminate this error. Also, the flight dynamics of fixed-wing MAVs cannot be assumed linear, and the technique used in this paper gives a very accurate flight dynamics estimation.},

  abstract = {In the future, MAVs will most likely emerge in operational use in fixed wing, rotary wing, and finally, flapping wing configurations. This is due to the inherent difficulties in optimizing rotary and flapping wing designs. The three classes of designs will emerge with varying capabilities, and for a time, the fixed wing systems will have the greatest endurance for a given mass. But then ornithopters or flapping wing aircraft may become the dominant configuration as wingspans shrink and requirements evolve, with spans of less than 1 cm, and masses less than 1 gram. This is where biological flyers can show us how to best operate in those extremely low Reynolds numbers regimes. AeroVironment has developed some of the early pioneering MAVs, which were very useful in developing tools for understanding and optimizing these diminutive flyers. The Microbat MAV is a 23 cm span, electric, remotely piloted, flapping wing ornithopter capable of flying for over 22 minutes. The Black Widow MAV is a 15 cm span, electric, remotely piloted flying wing with a color video payload that can operate at a 2 km range with an endurance of 30 minutes. 1 Through careful analysis of propulsion systems, energy storage systems, and aerodynamic design, optimization tools can be developed and utilized to design MAVs with surprisingly high performance. This paper examines the current state of the art of several MAV subsystem technologies, provides a near-term outlook for the future, and suggests areas that could benefit from further research.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of propeller-induced flow effects on the dynamics of a fixed wing biplane micro air vehicle. The analysis is based on wind tunnel tests and mathematical modeling. This analysis plays a pivotal role because the propeller-induced flow has significant effects on the dynamics of fixed wing micro air vehicle due to submergence of a large portion of the wing in propeller slipstream. Although the effect of the propeller-induced flow on the various aerodynamic parameter is reported in the literature; however, its effects on overall forces, moments and vehicle dynamics are not quantified so far. In this paper, propeller-induced flow effects are modeled as a function of motor rotation speed and mathematical analysis is performed to quantify their effects. The wind tunnel test is conducted at different propeller speeds on a biplane micro air vehicle “Skylark”, having wingspan and chord length of 150 mm and 140 mm, respectively. Analysis of results shows that the propeller slipstream increases the overall lift, drag, side force, range, and endurance significantly. Propeller flow also contributes to the rolling moment and the pitching moment, while it has negligible effects on the yawing moment. It is shown that the trim angle of attack is lower when the propeller flow is considered in computing the trim conditions.},

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear coupled longitudinal and lateral state space model are compared with and without propeller flow effects. The variation in the natural frequencies and damping ratios of short period mode, phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode are analyzed for various trim airspeed. An increase in the natural frequency is observed for phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode with propeller effects. The stability of the spiral mode is enhanced by the propeller flow and also the response of the roll subsidence mode is faster with propeller effects.

  abstract = {A propulsion system (DC electric motor and propeller) was installed on micro air vehicle wind tunnel models of 3, 6 and 9\% camber. In one set of tests the motor was mounted in its typical location; in the next test set the motor was angled both toward and then away from the leading edge; and in the final set of tests the motor was extended 1/2 inch away from the leading edge from its usual location. All models had wingspans of 9" and wing areas of 60 in 2. The models were tested in the Low Speed Wind Tunnel, with the propulsion system activated (motor-on testing), at angles of attack ranging from 4 to 43° or 0 to 35.1°, depending on the test set, at velocities of 5, 7.5 and 10 m/s, corresponding to mean aerodynamic chord Reynolds numbers of 5×104,7.5×104, and 1×105, respectively. CL, CD, CM-c/4 and L/D were obtained and plotted versus angle of attack at each velocity. The aerodynamic coefficients obtained from the motor-on testing were compared to those obtained from a previous study that were completed without a propulsion system installed. In general, it was found that the propulsive-induced flow had a positive effect on the aerodynamics of the micro air vehicle models at higher angles of attack, particularly for low Reynolds number tests, and motors angled away from the leading edge. It was also found that relocating the motor forward from its usual mounting position increased both the lift and drag coefficients. However, due to the way that the aerodynamic coefficients were calculated, the effects in the aerodynamic coefficients are partly a mathematical phenomenon. In other words, at low Reynolds numbers there is an increase in the lift coefficient, but it is due to the way that the lift coefficient is calculated. Because this reduction in the Reynolds number is due to a reduction in speed, the actual lift produced at these low speeds may decrease faster than the lift coefficient increases.

  abstract = {The Air Force Research Lab, Munitions Directorate has designed a man-portable Micro-Air-Vehicle (MAV) used for on-the-spot reconnaissance and post-strike Battle Damage Assessment. The wing on this 24″ span, 6″ chord MAV consists of a flexible parachute material attached to a rigid carbon-fiber skeleton, and deforms considerably under aerodynamic loading. The effect this flexible structure has on aerodynamic performance characteristics was assessed in wind tunnel tests at the Air Force Institute of Technology. Forces and moments were measured for the flexible wing MAV and a rigid wing counterpart, enabling the isolation of the effect of flexure. Measurements indicated that increased wing flexure delayed stall and increased the maximum value of L/D by approximately 20 to 30 percent for airspeeds ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour. The flexible wing MAV displayed static stability in all three principal control axes. The vehicle's response to control surface deflection was also measured. These deflections resulted in predictable and consistent performance between-10° and +10° deflection. Responses declined steadily after ±10°, and in some circumstances, showed slope sign reversal, evidently due to separation effects. Preliminary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and XFOIL predictions are presented for the 2-D rigid wing and compared to experimental data.},

  abstract = {In this research effect of propeller induced flow on aerodynamic characteristics of low aspect ratio flying wing micro aerial vehicle has been investigated experimentally in subsonic wind tunnel. Left turning tendencies of right-handed propellers have been discussed in literature, but not much work has been done to quantify them. In this research, we have quantified these tendencies as a change in aerodynamic coefficient with a change in advance ratio at a longitudinal trim angle of attack using subsonic wind tunnel. For experimental testing, three fixed pitch propeller diameters (5 inch, 6 inch and 7 inch), three propeller rotational speeds (7800, 10800 and 12300 RPMs) and three wind tunnel speeds (10, 15 and 20 m/s) have been considered to form up 27 advance ratios. Additionally, wind tunnel tests of 9 wind mill cases were conducted and considered as baseline. Experimental uncertainty assessment for measurement of forces and moments was carried out before conduct of wind tunnel tests. Large variation in lift, drag, yawing moment and rolling moment was captured at low advance ratios, which indicated their significance at high propeller rotational speeds and large propeller diameters. Side force and pitching moment did not reflect any significant change. LD at trim point was found a nonlinear function of propeller diameter to wingspan ratio Db , and propeller rotational speed. Rate and control derivatives were obtained using unsteady vortex lattice method with propeller induced flow effect modeled by Helical Vortex Modeling approach. In this research, we have proposed improved 6-DOF equations of motion, with a contribution of advance ratio J. It is concluded, that propeller induced flow effects have a significant contribution in flight dynamic modeling for vehicles with large propeller diameter to wingspan ratio, Db of 22\% or more.},

Furthermore, the effects of a tractor propeller slipstream on both wing aerodynamics and transition front were studied. For tests, a rectangular wing was used with a NACA 6-series airfoil section and with a total of 22 pressure orifices. Unsteady pressure measurements were performed over the upper and lower surfaces of the wing in different spanwise locations at different incidence angles. Existence of propeller slipstream changed pressure distribution over the wing surfaces, in both chordwise and spanwise directions and hence affected the wing loading distribution. Statistical analysis of pressure signals was used to predict the boundary layer transition over the wing by computing the root mean square and skewness of the pressure data. The results showed that the transition location moves toward the leading edge due to propeller slipstream. Increase in propeller rotational speed causes that the turbulent flow covers whole portion of the wing surface.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of a rotatable tail mechanism applied to a small unmanned aerial vehicle was performed using a six-component wind-tunnel balance in the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology low-speed wind tunnel. Attributes of the control and stability characteristics of the original vehicle, which were documented in an earlier study, are compared with those of a unique control methodology, a tall consisting of a single surface, with controllable elevation and rotation. An advantage of this change is a reduction in the storage length of the vehicle. Because there are similarities in the rotatable tail mechanism and the tail of many birds, the rotatable tail reflects a biomimetric feature. Measured force and moment coefficient measurements for the actual vehicle at a typical flight speed indicated that a rotatable tail provides a suffident yaw moment for turning. For example, yaw moment coefficients Cn, ranging from -0.02 to +0.02, which is typical tor a rudder, were achievable as long as the absolute value of the tall elevation angle was large. The dependence of the yaw moment coefficient on the elevator angle and angle of attack, in addition to the tail rotation angle, indicates that there would be significant chalenges in applying a robust flight control scheme with the current actuator configuration. An additional feature of the tail design is that by deflecting the tail upward, it could also function effectively as an air brake. A more than twofold increase in drag coefficient for constant angle of attack was measured when the tail elevation angle was increased to nearly 70 deg.},

  abstract = {Novel findings are discussed in this paper that will be especially beneficial to designers and modelers of small-scale unmanned air vehicles and high-altitude long-endurance vehicles that both operate at low Reynolds numbers (Re = 50;000-300;000). Propeller-induced flow effects in both tractor and pusher configurations on a rectangular wing using the Wortmann FX 63-137 airfoil (a common low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil) are presented in this paper. Significant performance benefits can be found for a wing in the tractor configuration. Experiments, including trip tests and upper-surface oil flow visualization, show and verify that the propeller slipstream induces early transition to turbulent flow in the regions within the slipstream and the premature formation of a separation bubble in the regions outside the slipstream. The result is a reduction of pressure drag and an increase in lift of the wing where lift-to-drag ratios are as high as 10-12 (a maximum of 70\% increase in lift-to-drag ratio from a clean wing configuration) and are measured at both low and high angles of attack up to stall (0-16 deg). Similar performance benefits are not observed in pusher configuration results where only increased local flow velocity and varying inflow angle effects are apparent. Thus, contrary to the design rules for optimal performance of wings at high Reynolds numbers, at low Reynolds numbers, a propeller in the tractor configuration exhibits significant performance improvements, especially in cruise configurations (low angles of attack), as compared with a propeller in the pusher configuration or even a clean wing.},

  abstract = {Fixed wing micro air vehicles (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging due to the low Reynolds number regime (104-105) they operate in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10-15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, and the range of stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with geometric twist (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed. Multi-objective optimization aimed at improving lift, drag, and pitching moment considerations is also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To this end, several flapping-wing configurations are considered. First, the problem of single flapping wings is treated with special emphasis on the dependence of thrust, lift, and propulsive efficiency on flapping mode, amplitude, frequency, and wing shape. Second, the problem of hovering flight is studied for single flapping wings. Third, the aerodynamic phenomena and benefits produced by the flapping-wing interactions on tandem wings or biplane configurations are discussed. Such interactions occur on dragonflies or on a recently developed micro air vehicle. The currently available two- and three-dimensional inviscid and viscous flapping-wing flow solutions are presented. It is shown that the results are strongly dependent on flapping frequency, amplitude, and Reynolds number. These findings are substantiated by comparison with the available experimental data.},

  abstract = {A micro air vehicle (MAV) is a class of miniature unmanned aerial vehicles that has a size restriction and may be autonomous. Fixed-wing MAVs are very attractive for outdoor surveillance missions since they generally offer better payload and endurance capabilities than rotorcraft or flapping-wing vehicles of equal size. This research paper describes the methodology applying indicial function theory and artificial neural networks for identification of aerodynamic derivatives for fixed-wing MAV. The formulation herein proposed extends well- known aerodynamic theories, which are limited to thin aerofoils in incompressible flow, to strake wing planforms. Using results from dynamic water tunnel tests and indicial functions approach allowed to identify MAV aerodynamic derivatives. The experiments were conducted in a water tunnel in the course of dynamic tests of periodic oscillatory motion. The tests program range was set at high angles of attack and a wide scope of reduced frequencies of angular movements. Due to a built-in propeller, the model\&rsquo;s structure test program was repeated for a turned-on propelled drive system. As a result of these studies, unsteady aerodynamics characteristics and aerodynamic derivatives of the micro-aircraft were identified as functions of state parameters. At the Warsaw University of Technology and the Air Force Institute of Technology, a \&ldquo;Bee\&rdquo; fixed wings micro aerial vehicle with an innovative strake-wing outline and a propeller placed in the wing gap was worked. This article is devoted to the problems of identification of aerodynamic derivatives of this micro-aircraft. The result of this research was the identification of the aerodynamic derivatives of the fixed wing MAV \&ldquo;Bee\&rdquo; as non-linear functions of the angle of attack, and reduced frequency. The identification was carried out using the indicial function approach.},

  abstract = {The development of micro aerial vehicles has been hindered by a poor understanding of the flight dynamics associated with the unique aerodynamic regime. This study experimentally estimates the aerodynamic damping derivatives of flat-plate wings with aspect ratios less than 3 at a Reynolds number of 7.5 × 104 ; when combined with previously published results detailing the lateral and longitudinal static loads, a dynamic model is developed for low-aspect-ratio wings. The initial-condition response of the linear equations of motion shows that the loading created by roll stall results in purely aerodynamic lateral modes which, unlike conventional aircraft, are not attributed to geometric features, such as the vertical tail; this response was favorably compared with the integration of the full nonlinear equations. The mode is manifested by divergent, high-amplitude perturbations in sideslip, bank angle, and roll rate; furthermore, it is seen to be affected by angle of attack variations, which significantly alter the instantaneous value of the roll stability derivative Lβ . If the input frequency of the angle of attack oscillations is close to the natural frequency of the pure lateral mode, the bank angle is seen to drift away from its equilibrium value due to an attenuated restoring roll moment. This represents a previously unconsidered stability mode, referred to as roll-resonance, which couples the lateral and longitudinal stability axes for small perturbations from equilibrium flight conditions.},

To define the overall scope and key research areas of a possible cross technical directorate effort in Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM), a team of health management experts from the Air Force, industry and academia was assembled to explore the design related benefits of ISHM. This team defined a set of scenarios made possible by the ideal ISHM system. These scenarios and the technologies associated with them were evaluated for their system impact, design impact, innovativeness and timeliness. The scenarios were grouped into four benefit categories and the technology needs associated with the scenarios defined. The result is a prioritized set of technology development needs linked to specific benefits and scenarios. The benefits of the ideal ISHM system were quantified from a cost and capability perspective based on the specific scenarios and data provided by the participants. The collected benefits provide a compelling rationale for pursuing the development of fully integrated ISHM design capability and the technology development defined in the study. Finally, the study developed a proposal for specific next steps, connecting the individual technology development needs with an overarching program direction and set of midterm demonstrations to support that development.12 © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Morphing wings comprised of fixed leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces have emerged as a novel active control technique for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the wake dynamics and aerodynamic performance of such hybrid airfoil configuration has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional flows over hybrid airfoils comprised of NACA 0012 leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces are performed at a fixed Reynolds number of 1000. The effects of length and camber of the trailing control surface on the laminar aerodynamic characteristics are studied over a wide range of angle of attack. It is shown that the flow behind the airfoil exhibits different features, including steady flow, periodic vortex shedding, and quasi-periodic vortex shedding for different configurations. The transition between these wake states occurs at slightly smaller angles of attack compared to the nominal NACA 0012 airfoil. While the drag coefficient remains close to each other at a fixed angle of attack, the lift coefficient of the hybrid airfoil is positively affected by the length and camber of the trailing control surface. The mechanism of lift generation is examined by surface pressure distributions and a force element analysis. It is revealed that with increased camber of the trailing control surface, the flow on both the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil are modified in a beneficial way to enhance lift. Increasing the length ratio only significantly modifies the flow near the aft section on the pressure side. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic characterization of hybrid airfoils with trailing control surfaces, and could potentially aid the design of control techniques for next-generation small unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract = {The mutual interaction of laminar–turbulent transition and mean flow evolution is studied in a pressure-induced laminar separation bubble on a flat plate. The flat-plate boundary layer is subjected to a sufficiently strong adverse pressure gradient that a separation bubble develops. Upstream of the bubble a small-amplitude disturbance is introduced which causes transition. Downstream of transition, the mean flow strongly changes and, due to viscous–inviscid interaction, the overall pressure distribution is changed as well. As a consequence, the mean flow also changes upstream of the transition location. The difference in the mean flow between the forced and the unforced flows is denoted the mean flow deformation. Two different effects are caused by the mean flow deformation in the upstream, laminar part: a reduction of the size of the separation region and a stabilization of the flow with respect to small, linear perturbations. By carrying out numerical simulations based on the original base flow and the time-averaged deformed base flow, we are able to distinguish between direct and indirect nonlinear effects. Direct effects are caused by the quadratic nonlinearity of the Navier–Stokes equations, are associated with the generation of higher harmonics and are predominantly local. In contrast, the stabilization of the flow is an indirect effect, because it is independent of the Reynolds stress terms in the laminar region and is solely governed by the non-local alteration of the mean flow via the pressure.},

In this low-to-moderate aspect ratio range, experimental data for use in validation of computational methods and design is lacking in the literature, yet this range spans that of many typical modern small-scale UAVs that operate in the 50,000 to 150,000 Reynolds number range. A custom three-component force balance for measuring lift, drag, and moment is described in detail and validated. Both straight and tapered wings were wind tunnel tested, and flow visualization was performed to characterize the flow. The measurements showed that all wings exhibited sensitivity to changes in aspect ratio and Reynolds number. Oswald's efficiency factors derived from the measurements ranged from a low value of 0.3 to more typical values near 0.8. Additionally, the aerodynamic performance trends relating to the maximum lift coefficient, lift curve slope, and aerodynamic center are computed from the measurements and discussed for the flat-plate wing models. Finally, no hysteresis in angle of attack was observed over the range of Reynolds numbers tested.},

  abstract = {The flight dynamics of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which cannot be ignored in simulation or analysis. In this study, a full nonlinear simulation of the flight dynamics characteristics of a fixed-wing MAV is performed. To strengthen the developed nonlinear mathematical modeling, the MAV’s mass properties and propulsion characteristics are experimentally investigated. Moreover, the aerodynamic characteristics of the designed fixed-wing MAV are experimentally measured in a wind tunnel. The experimental aerodynamics investigation includes the propeller wash effect and the same flight conditions of the MAV. These measured data are fed to the nonlinear flight dynamics model to improve its accuracy and ensure the nonlinear aerodynamics effect on the flight dynamics. The enhanced model is then validated against response experimental measurements of the MAV in the wind tunnel that is free to pitch at different control inputs and initial conditions. Furthermore, it is compared to the response of the system identification model. The nonlinear simulation and dynamic testing investigations indicate many nonlinear phenomena, such as the appearance of the limit cycle in the longitudinal flight. This paper shows that the aerodynamic center of MAV with a low aspect ratio in the low Reynolds number regime of flow can move as a response to flap deflection. The validated nonlinear mathematical model was used to evaluate the MAV’s dynamics, design and evaluate a PID controller in flight conditions similar to the MAV’s actual flying mission. Moreover, the presented model can be used for flapping-wing MAVs using time-dependent experimental measurements.},

   abstract = {The reduction of wingtip vortices is a critical and challenging task for aircraft wing-design. Inspired by the wingtip morphology of soaring birds, Whitcomb created winglets to reduce the drag of commercial airplanes significantly. As a critical feature of bird flight, the dynamic flapping wing motion could potentially affect the evolution of tip vortices, which has been rarely investigated. To explore the control mechanisms of wingtip vortices by flapping, a flapping wing model with two-jointed arms was designed to mimic geese's flapping motion. The evolution of tip vortices was recorded in a wind tunnel using particle image velocimetry (PIV) system, and physical features were analyzed. It is shown that wingtip vortices change the vorticity concentration and vortex radius as wings flap in a cycle. The continuous coherent streamwise structure could pinch off at the upstroke end. As flapping frequency increases, the vorticity-concentrated tip vortices become dispersed. Circulation change in a cycle is dramatic, and the tip vortices present a directly up- and downward movement, which indicates a wave-like trajectory. Flapping induces the wingtip vortices to wander in a large amplitude and a specific direction instead of randomly in a limited region. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) results show that flapping can not only affect the vorticity concentration and radius of tip vortices as well as energy contribution of the first mode, but also increase the energy contribution and induce the coherent field of the second mode into a time-dependent vortex pair. The relative energy contribution and direction of the vortex pair vary with flapping motion, which affects the wandering amplitude and direction. It is suggested that flapping can break up the vorticity-concentrated wingtip vortices, and give them ordered evolution trajectory and directional wandering motion, which could shed light on the effective vortex control and drag reduction for aircraft wing-design.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are affordable these days. For that reason, there are currently examples of the use of UAVs in recreational, professional and research applications. Most of the commercial UAVs use Px4 for their operating system. Even though Px4 allows one to change the flight controller structure, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) format is still by far the most popular choice. A selection of the PID controller parameters is required before the UAV can be used. Although there are guidelines for the design of PID parameters, they do not guarantee the stability of the UAV, which in many cases, leads to collisions involving the UAV during the calibration process. In this paper, an offline tuning procedure based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for the attitude and altitude control of a Px4-based UAV is proposed. A Pareto dominance concept is used for the MOPSO to find values for the PID comparing parameters of step responses (overshoot, rise time and root-mean-square). Experimental results are provided to validate the proposed tuning procedure by using a quadrotor as a case study.},

Compared to other more expensive remote-sensing technology, DJI Phantom series SUA provide a trade-off between cost, sensor quality, functionality and portability. Because of the significant interest in such systems, rigorous accuracy assessment of metric performance is crucial. This research investigates the capabilities of the Phantom 4 Pro (P4P) and the recently launched Phantom 4 RTK (P4RTK) SUA through both laboratory and in-situ assessments with multi-scale photogrammetric blocks. The study adopts self-calibrating bundle adjustments from conventional photogrammetry and from a Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-photogrammetric approach. Both systems deliver planimetric and vertical absolute accuracies of better than one and two pixels ground sampling distance, respectively, against independent check points. This can be achieved if the imaging network configuration includes a mixed range of nadir and oblique imagery and several ground control points are established as reference information. Ongoing analysis is investigating the strength of all bundle adjustment solutions. It is also evaluating the GNSS capabilities of the P4RTK SUA after post-processing raw observations of its trajectory. Findings from a comprehensive accuracy assessment can support non-experts in designing the pre-flight photogrammetric data acquisition plan and aid understanding of the performance of such popular off-the-shelf SUA.},

As aerospace systems require greater precision, the ability to account for small disturbances and errors becomes more important. Monte Carlo simulation has been the traditional method for analyzing a design in the presence of uncertainty, but the incredible computational cost of both a Monte Carlo simulation and CFD make it incredibly time-consuming to find the full range of responses of an uncertain system. This paper demonstrates a method for using wind tunnel testing and a statistical description of turbulence characteristics to efficiently analyze the open loop dynamics of a micro air vehicle.

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to the propeller slipstream/wing interaction problem in the transonic regime. Approximations consistent with the physical problem of a nearly uniform slipstream interacting with a thin wing allow the perturbation velocities due to the interaction to be potential although the undisturbed slipstream is rotational. The resulting boundary-value problem is solved by standard finitedifference schemes for transonic potential flows. The approach presented here overcomes the deficiencies of panel methods which fail to correctly predict solutions in supersonic patches and at shock waves. The advantages of the present approach over solving the Euler equations include its relative simplicity, small computer storage requirements, and short computational time. The basic characteristics of the slipstream/wing interaction are demonstrated through simple numerical examples. They indicate that the slipstream has a strong effect on the aerodynamic properties of the wing section within the slipstream and lesser effects elsewhere. The slipstream swirling motion strongly affects the wing load distribution; however, its effect on the wing’s total lift and wave drag is small. The axial velocity increment in the slipstream has a small effect on the wing lift; however, it causes a large increase in wave drag. © 1981 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The Reynolds number based on the mean aerodynamic chord was 1.3 × 10 5. Significant aerodynamic performance benefits could be found for a propeller in the tractor configuration. The numerical results showed that the propeller slipstream effect on the wings was highly dependent on the size of the propeller, and the major slipstream effect was working at 60\% inboard wingspan, whereas less effects were observed towards the wingtip. The propeller slipstream increased the local angle of attack on the up-going blade side. This effect simultaneously augmented the section lift. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations helped to improve understanding of the interaction of the propeller wake and the wing-fuselage, which is an important aspect to guide the design of future efficient and controllable micro air vehicles. The results indicated that, in MAV designs, the slipstream from the propeller had a significant effect on the wing aerodynamics, regarding both performance and stability of the vehicle.},

The aerodynamic model consists of a Truckenbrodt 3D lifting surface method, coupled with an airfoil numerical solver for taking into account viscosity and camber effects, and a blade element theory for the formulation of the propeller aerodynamics. Results of the proposed method are validated against RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) data for a conventional four-propeller transport aircraft and a novel Contra-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) aircraft. A good agreement with the high fidelity solutions is obtained. The low computational cost makes the method attractive and suitable for performing extensive studies such as Multi-Disciplinary Optimisation (MDO) or to explore several alternative designs during the conceptual and preliminary design phases.},

  abstract = {Hovering is a miracle of insects that is observed for all sizes of flying insects. Sizing effect in insect hovering on flapping-wing aerodynamics is of interest to both the micro-air-vehicle (MAV) community and also of importance to comparative morphologists. In this study, we present an integrated computational study of such size effects on insect hovering aerodynamics, which is performed using a biology-inspired dynamic flight simulator that integrates the modelling of realistic wing-body morphology, the modelling of flapping-wing and body kinematics and an in-house Navier-Stokes solver. Results of four typical insect hovering flights including a hawkmoth, a honeybee, a fruit fly and a thrips, over a wide range of Reynolds numbers from O(104) to O(101) are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility of the present integrated computational methods in quantitatively modelling and evaluating the unsteady aerodynamics in insect flapping flight. Our results based on realistically modelling of insect hovering therefore offer an integrated understanding of the near-field vortex dynamics, the far-field wake and downwash structures, and their correlation with the force production in terms of sizing and Reynolds number as well as wing kinematics. Our results not only give an integrated interpretation on the similarity and discrepancy of the near- and far-field vortex structures in insect hovering but also demonstrate that our methods can be an effective tool in the MAVs design. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {A motion tracking system was used to experimentally determine the aerodynamic forces and moments of two micro UAVs. The airplanes have wingspans ranging from approximately 9 to 15 in and fly at Reynolds numbers below 25,000. The motion track provided a time history of the position and attitude and was used to derive the aerodynamic moments and analyze the stability derivatives of the airplanes. A reconfigurable hand-launched glider was used to show results for different wing configurations. In addition to the glider, a small commercially manufactured SU-26xp airplane was used. The longitudinal stability measurements from experimental data showed both airplanes to be more stable than predictions based on geometry. The SU-26xp airplane was used to study the effects of elevator deflection on trim flight conditions. In addition, the lateral stability terms for both airplane were measured. By understanding the stability and control over a range of flight conditions, a better understanding of the control of micro UAVs can be developed. © 2011 by Daniel V. Uhlig and Michael S. Selig.},

The performance of attitude control systems themselves are affected by a variety of factors. Assessment of this system's performance needs to be viewed in relation to the MAVs' unique constraints. Certain aspects and limitations of MAV attitude control related issues are addressed in the literature, but to fully address the degradation of utility, the entire system must be examined. These issues can only be fully addressed when considering them concurrently. There is no framework for defining the attitude control problem explicitly for MAVs. This paper attempts to (1) Define the MAV attitude control problem with respect to the unique constraints imposed by this class of Unmanned Aircraft; (2) Review current design trends of MAVs with respect to vulnerability to atmospheric turbulence.},

AM reduces the time and effort required to fabricate a complete aircraft, allowing for rapid design iterations and flight testing. Co-Kriging surrogate models allow data collected from test flights to correct Kriging models trained with numerically simulated data. The resulting model provides physically accurate and computationally cheap aircraft performance predictions. A global optimiser is used to search this model to find an optimal design for a bespoke aircraft. This paper presents the design loop and a case study which demonstrates its application.},

During the conceptual design, classical procedures and data from similar unmanned aerial vehicles already designed were employed to define the requirements related to unmanned aerial vehicle design. The preliminary design was performed using panel method where the emphasis was given on the design of the UAV wing, fuselage design and empennage. The wing planform parameters were determined through an aerodynamic optimization process using both genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks. Finally an aerodynamic analysis using panel method, Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations and wind tunnel testing was carried out. Unmanned aerial vehicle full configuration design process was consistent, where a comparison between the final obtained results was carried out and showed an agreement in terms of lift, drag and pitch moment coefficients.},

This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of the propeller-wing interaction effects for the wingtip-mounted propeller configuration, including a comparison with a conventional configuration with the propeller mounted on the inboard part of the wing. Measurements were taken in a low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology, with two wing models and a low-speed propeller. Particle-image-velocimetry measurements downstream of a symmetric wing with integrated flap highlighted the swirl reductions characteristic of the wingtip-mounted propeller due to wingtip-vortex attenuation and swirl recovery. External-balance and surface-pressure measurements confirmed that this led to an induced-drag reduction with inboard-up propeller rotation. In a direct comparison with a conventional propeller-wing layout, the wingtip-mounted configuration showed a drag reduction of around 15\% at a lift coefficient of 0.5 and a thrust coefficient of 0.12. This aerodynamic benefit increased upon increasing the wing lift coefficient and propeller thrust setting. An analysis of the wing performance showed that the aerodynamic benefit of the wingtip-mounted propeller was due to an increase of the wing's effective span-efficiency parameter.},

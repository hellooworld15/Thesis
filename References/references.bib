   abstract = {In this paper, the design process of a fixed-wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) is presented. The design cycle begins with mission requirements, followed by collecting statistical data from available MAVs. Next, MAV's sizing and weight estimation are conducted based on mission requirements. Finally, the aspect ratio, taper ratio, and airfoil selection are performed. As the MAV has a low aspect ratio and low Reynolds number airflow, the aerodynamics is not fully understood. The propeller wash increases the complexity of the aerodynamic flow; therefore, the MAV is manufactured for wind tunnel testing. The absent of actual flight performance and flight dynamics of fixed-wing MAVs are the main driven factors for this research. The wind tunnel experimental data are used in the flight performance equations to evaluate the MAV's actual flight performance and compare it with the estimated values. As MAV is very sensitive to the external disturbances which make the prediction of its dynamics a hard task, a nonlinear flight simulation model is created for the MAV's dynamics prediction. This model uses the experimentally measured data to predict the MAV's dynamics and its stability against wind disturbances. The results in this paper indicate that using aerodynamics historical data will give a huge error in estimating MAV's flight performance. The measured data in this research can be used to eliminate this error. Also, the flight dynamics of fixed-wing MAVs cannot be assumed linear, and the technique used in this paper gives a very accurate flight dynamics estimation.},

   abstract = {The flight dynamics of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which cannot be ignored in simulation or analysis. In this study, a full nonlinear simulation of the flight dynamics characteristics of a fixed-wing MAV is performed. To strengthen the developed nonlinear mathematical modeling, the MAV’s mass properties and propulsion characteristics are experimentally investigated. Moreover, the aerodynamic characteristics of the designed fixed-wing MAV are experimentally measured in a wind tunnel. The experimental aerodynamics investigation includes the propeller wash effect and the same flight conditions of the MAV. These measured data are fed to the nonlinear flight dynamics model to improve its accuracy and ensure the nonlinear aerodynamics effect on the flight dynamics. The enhanced model is then validated against response experimental measurements of the MAV in the wind tunnel that is free to pitch at different control inputs and initial conditions. Furthermore, it is compared to the response of the system identification model. The nonlinear simulation and dynamic testing investigations indicate many nonlinear phenomena, such as the appearance of the limit cycle in the longitudinal flight. This paper shows that the aerodynamic center of MAV with a low aspect ratio in the low Reynolds number regime of flow can move as a response to flap deflection. The validated nonlinear mathematical model was used to evaluate the MAV’s dynamics, design and evaluate a PID controller in flight conditions similar to the MAV’s actual flying mission. Moreover, the presented model can be used for flapping-wing MAVs using time-dependent experimental measurements.},

A custom three-component force balance for measuring lift, drag, and moment is described in detail and validated. Both straight and tapered wings were wind tunnel tested, and flow visualization was performed to characterize the flow. The measurements showed that all wings exhibited sensitivity to changes in aspect ratio and Reynolds number. Oswald's efficiency factors derived from the measurements ranged from a low value of 0.3 to more typical values near 0.8. Additionally, the aerodynamic performance trends relating to the maximum lift coefficient, lift curve slope, and aerodynamic center are computed from the measurements and discussed for the flat-plate wing models. Finally, no hysteresis in angle of attack was observed over the range of Reynolds numbers tested.},

   abstract = {A numerical investigation on propeller-induced flow effects in tractor configurations on a Zimmerman wing-fuselage using the cambered thin airfoil is presented in this paper. The Reynolds number based on the mean aerodynamic chord was 1.3 × 10 5. Significant aerodynamic performance benefits could be found for a propeller in the tractor configuration. The numerical results showed that the propeller slipstream effect on the wings was highly dependent on the size of the propeller, and the major slipstream effect was working at 60% inboard wingspan, whereas less effects were observed towards the wingtip. The propeller slipstream increased the local angle of attack on the up-going blade side. This effect simultaneously augmented the section lift. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations helped to improve understanding of the interaction of the propeller wake and the wing-fuselage, which is an important aspect to guide the design of future efficient and controllable micro air vehicles. The results indicated that, in MAV designs, the slipstream from the propeller had a significant effect on the wing aerodynamics, regarding both performance and stability of the vehicle.},

This study's primary objective is to present the effect of the interactions between a low aspect ratio wing and propeller for a range of incidence in transition between horizontal and vertical flight. During the transition from horizontal flight to vertical flight or vice versa, the flow patterns seen by the wing are the result of the combination between the free-stream and the propeller flow. This was reflected in the change of the aerodynamic forces and moments of the wing. The model is a tractor configuration propeller and with a wing of aspect ratio equal to one, the airfoil of the wing is a NACA 0012. All tests were conducted at low speeds in a range from 2 to 8 m/s. In order to simulate the transition flight of a tilt-body MAV VTOL a range of incidence from-10 to 90 degrees was used. The results show that the flow of the propeller certainly improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, increasing the lift and delaying stall with respect to the flight path of the MAV.},

The wing on this 24″ span, 6″ chord MAV consists of a flexible parachute material attached to a rigid carbon-fiber skeleton, and deforms considerably under aerodynamic loading. The effect this flexible structure has on aerodynamic performance characteristics was assessed in wind tunnel tests at the Air Force Institute of Technology. Forces and moments were measured for the flexible wing MAV and a rigid wing counterpart, enabling the isolation of the effect of flexure. Measurements indicated that increased wing flexure delayed stall and increased the maximum value of L/D by approximately 20 to 30 percent for airspeeds ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour. The flexible wing MAV displayed static stability in all three principal control axes. The vehicle's response to control surface deflection was also measured. These deflections resulted in predictable and consistent performance between-10° and +10° deflection. Responses declined steadily after ±10°, and in some circumstances, showed slope sign reversal, evidently due to separation effects. Preliminary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and XFOIL predictions are presented for the 2-D rigid wing and compared to experimental data.},

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are affordable these days. For that reason, there are currently examples of the use of UAVs in recreational, professional and research applications. Most of the commercial UAVs use Px4 for their operating system. Even though Px4 allows one to change the flight controller structure, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) format is still by far the most popular choice. A selection of the PID controller parameters is required before the UAV can be used. Although there are guidelines for the design of PID parameters, they do not guarantee the stability of the UAV, which in many cases, leads to collisions involving the UAV during the calibration process. In this paper, an offline tuning procedure based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for the attitude and altitude control of a Px4-based UAV is proposed. A Pareto dominance concept is used for the MOPSO to find values for the PID comparing parameters of step responses (overshoot, rise time and root-mean-square). Experimental results are provided to validate the proposed tuning procedure by using a quadrotor as a case study.},

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear coupled longitudinal and lateral state space model are compared with and without propeller flow effects. The variation in the natural frequencies and damping ratios of short period mode, phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode are analyzed for various trim airspeed. An increase in the natural frequency is observed for phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode with propeller effects. The stability of the spiral mode is enhanced by the propeller flow and also the response of the roll subsidence mode is faster with propeller effects. Detailed analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors shows the importance of incorporating propeller flow in analyzing the dynamics of the MAV.},

   abstract = {The conceptual design and optimization of a tilt-rotor Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) for a well-defined mission are performed. The objective of this design cycle is to decrease the design time in order to efficiently create a functional tilt-rotor drone. A flight mission is firstly defined for a tilt-rotor MAV performing hovering and cruise flight scenarios. Secondly, a complex wing shape is chosen and modeled in order to determine the final shape. The initial shape is scaled in order to acquire an arbitrary wingspan of one meter. For the specific area and wingspan, the aspect ratio of the designed wing shape is found to be equal to 2.32. Thirdly, a constraint analysis of the MAV is performed by using an energy balance analysis for six different flight scenarios. This analysis yields the required power loading and wing loading. Fourthly, the weight of the vehicle is estimated using both statistical and computational methods. After estimating the total weight and the wing loading of the MAV, the surface of the wing is determined, yielding a final wingspan of 0.76 m. Subsequently, considering the total weight of the designed MAV, the needed lift coefficient is determined. Fifthly, using the lift coefficient in conjunction with XLFR5, a batch of airfoils is selected and analyzed to evaluate the aerodynamic coefficients of the wing with each airfoil. This analysis ultimately leads to the optimum airfoil being selected. Finally, design of the fuselage and tail, internal components selection, and servo-mechanisms design are carried out prior to a stability analysis. All these proposed steps are needed to design efficient and functional tilt-rotor MAVs.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of propeller-induced flow effects on the dynamics of a fixed wing biplane micro air vehicle. The analysis is based on wind tunnel tests and mathematical modeling. This analysis plays a pivotal role because the propeller-induced flow has significant effects on the dynamics of fixed wing micro air vehicle due to submergence of a large portion of the wing in propeller slipstream. Although the effect of the propeller-induced flow on the various aerodynamic parameter is reported in the literature; however, its effects on overall forces, moments and vehicle dynamics are not quantified so far. In this paper, propeller-induced flow effects are modeled as a function of motor rotation speed and mathematical analysis is performed to quantify their effects. The wind tunnel test is conducted at different propeller speeds on a biplane micro air vehicle “Skylark”, having wingspan and chord length of 150 mm and 140 mm, respectively. Analysis of results shows that the propeller slipstream increases the overall lift, drag, side force, range, and endurance significantly. Propeller flow also contributes to the rolling moment and the pitching moment, while it has negligible effects on the yawing moment. It is shown that the trim angle of attack is lower when the propeller flow is considered in computing the trim conditions.},

Sizing effect in insect hovering on flapping-wing aerodynamics is of interest to both the micro-air-vehicle (MAV) community and also of importance to comparative morphologists. In this study, we present an integrated computational study of such size effects on insect hovering aerodynamics, which is performed using a biology-inspired dynamic flight simulator that integrates the modelling of realistic wing-body morphology, the modelling of flapping-wing and body kinematics and an in-house Navier-Stokes solver. Results of four typical insect hovering flights including a hawkmoth, a honeybee, a fruit fly and a thrips, over a wide range of Reynolds numbers from O(104) to O(101) are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility of the present integrated computational methods in quantitatively modelling and evaluating the unsteady aerodynamics in insect flapping flight. Our results based on realistically modelling of insect hovering therefore offer an integrated understanding of the near-field vortex dynamics, the far-field wake and downwash structures, and their correlation with the force production in terms of sizing and Reynolds number as well as wing kinematics. Our results not only give an integrated interpretation on the similarity and discrepancy of the near- and far-field vortex structures in insect hovering but also demonstrate that our methods can be an effective tool in the MAVs design. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The numerical results reveal that the source of the nonlinear aerodynamic behavior is the lift enhancement providedby the large leading-edge vortex generated.

   abstract = {A propulsion system (DC electric motor and propeller) was installed on micro air vehicle wind tunnel models of 3, 6 and 9% camber. In one set of tests the motor was mounted in its typical location; in the next test set the motor was angled both toward and then away from the leading edge; and in the final set of tests the motor was extended 1/2 inch away from the leading edge from its usual location. All models had wingspans of 9" and wing areas of 60 in 2. The models were tested in the Low Speed Wind Tunnel, with the propulsion system activated (motor-on testing), at angles of attack ranging from 4 to 43° or 0 to 35.1°, depending on the test set, at velocities of 5, 7.5 and 10 m/s, corresponding to mean aerodynamic chord Reynolds numbers of 5×104,7.5×104, and 1×105, respectively. CL, CD, CM-c/4 and L/D were obtained and plotted versus angle of attack at each velocity. The aerodynamic coefficients obtained from the motor-on testing were compared to those obtained from a previous study that were completed without a propulsion system installed. In general, it was found that the propulsive-induced flow had a positive effect on the aerodynamics of the micro air vehicle models at higher angles of attack, particularly for low Reynolds number tests, and motors angled away from the leading edge. It was also found that relocating the motor forward from its usual mounting position increased both the lift and drag coefficients. However, due to the way that the aerodynamic coefficients were calculated, the effects in the aerodynamic coefficients are partly a mathematical phenomenon. In other words, at low Reynolds numbers there is an increase in the lift coefficient, but it is due to the way that the lift coefficient is calculated. Because this reduction in the Reynolds number is due to a reduction in speed, the actual lift produced at these low speeds may decrease faster than the lift coefficient increases.

   abstract = {An experimental study of a rotatable tail mechanism applied to a small unmanned aerial vehicle was performed using a six-component wind-tunnel balance in the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology low-speed wind tunnel. Attributes of the control and stability characteristics of the original vehicle, which were documented in an earlier study, are compared with those of a unique control methodology, a tall consisting of a single surface, with controllable elevation and rotation. An advantage of this change is a reduction in the storage length of the vehicle. Because there are similarities in the rotatable tail mechanism and the tail of many birds, the rotatable tail reflects a biomimetric feature. Measured force and moment coefficient measurements for the actual vehicle at a typical flight speed indicated that a rotatable tail provides a suffident yaw moment for turning. For example, yaw moment coefficients Cn, ranging from -0.02 to +0.02, which is typical tor a rudder, were achievable as long as the absolute value of the tall elevation angle was large. The dependence of the yaw moment coefficient on the elevator angle and angle of attack, in addition to the tail rotation angle, indicates that there would be significant chalenges in applying a robust flight control scheme with the current actuator configuration. An additional feature of the tail design is that by deflecting the tail upward, it could also function effectively as an air brake. A more than twofold increase in drag coefficient for constant angle of attack was measured when the tail elevation angle was increased to nearly 70 deg.},

Compared to other more expensive remote-sensing technology, DJI Phantom series SUA provide a trade-off between cost, sensor quality, functionality and portability. Because of the significant interest in such systems, rigorous accuracy assessment of metric performance is crucial. This research investigates the capabilities of the Phantom 4 Pro (P4P) and the recently launched Phantom 4 RTK (P4RTK) SUA through both laboratory and in-situ assessments with multi-scale photogrammetric blocks. The study adopts self-calibrating bundle adjustments from conventional photogrammetry and from a Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-photogrammetric approach. Both systems deliver planimetric and vertical absolute accuracies of better than one and two pixels ground sampling distance, respectively, against independent check points. This can be achieved if the imaging network configuration includes a mixed range of nadir and oblique imagery and several ground control points are established as reference information. Ongoing analysis is investigating the strength of all bundle adjustment solutions. It is also evaluating the GNSS capabilities of the P4RTK SUA after post-processing raw observations of its trajectory. Findings from a comprehensive accuracy assessment can support non-experts in designing the pre-flight photogrammetric data acquisition plan and aid understanding of the performance of such popular off-the-shelf SUA.},

Second, the problem of hovering flight is studied for single flapping wings. Third, the aerodynamic phenomena and benefits produced by the flapping-wing interactions on tandem wings or biplane configurations are discussed. Such interactions occur on dragonflies or on a recently developed micro air vehicle. The currently available two- and three-dimensional inviscid and viscous flapping-wing flow solutions are presented. It is shown that the results are strongly dependent on flapping frequency, amplitude, and Reynolds number. These findings are substantiated by comparison with the available experimental data.},

As aerospace systems require greater precision, the ability to account for small disturbances and errors becomes more important. Monte Carlo simulation has been the traditional method for analyzing a design in the presence of uncertainty, but the incredible computational cost of both a Monte Carlo simulation and CFD make it incredibly time-consuming to find the full range of responses of an uncertain system. This paper demonstrates a method for using wind tunnel testing and a statistical description of turbulence characteristics to efficiently analyze the open loop dynamics of a micro air vehicle. Micro air vehicles are of special interest both because their mission effectiveness is more sensitive to turbulence and they experience greater turbulent fluctuations in their flight regime than larger faster vehicles. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

   abstract = {In this research effect of propeller induced flow on aerodynamic characteristics of low aspect ratio flying wing micro aerial vehicle has been investigated experimentally in subsonic wind tunnel. Left turning tendencies of right-handed propellers have been discussed in literature, but not much work has been done to quantify them. In this research, we have quantified these tendencies as a change in aerodynamic coefficient with a change in advance ratio at a longitudinal trim angle of attack using subsonic wind tunnel. For experimental testing, three fixed pitch propeller diameters (5 inch, 6 inch and 7 inch), three propeller rotational speeds (7800, 10800 and 12300 RPMs) and three wind tunnel speeds (10, 15 and 20 m/s) have been considered to form up 27 advance ratios. Additionally, wind tunnel tests of 9 wind mill cases were conducted and considered as baseline. Experimental uncertainty assessment for measurement of forces and moments was carried out before conduct of wind tunnel tests. Large variation in lift, drag, yawing moment and rolling moment was captured at low advance ratios, which indicated their significance at high propeller rotational speeds and large propeller diameters. Side force and pitching moment did not reflect any significant change. LD at trim point was found a nonlinear function of propeller diameter to wingspan ratio Db , and propeller rotational speed. Rate and control derivatives were obtained using unsteady vortex lattice method with propeller induced flow effect modeled by Helical Vortex Modeling approach. In this research, we have proposed improved 6-DOF equations of motion, with a contribution of advance ratio J. It is concluded, that propeller induced flow effects have a significant contribution in flight dynamic modeling for vehicles with large propeller diameter to wingspan ratio, Db of 22% or more.},

The selection procedure of airfoil has been developed by considering parameters related to aerodynamic efficiency and flight stability. Airfoil aerodynamic parameters have been calculated using a potential flow solver for ten candidate airfoils. Eppler-387 proved to be the most efficient reflexed airfoil and therefore was selected for fabrication and further flight testing of vehicle. Elevon control surfaces have been designed and evaluated for longitudinal and lateral control. The vehicle was fabricated using hot wire machine with EPP styrofoam of density 50 Kg/m3. Static aerodynamic coefficients were evaluated using wind tunnel tests conducted at cruise velocity of 20 m/s for varying angles of attack. Rate derivatives and elevon control derivatives have also been calculated. Equations of motion for FWMAV have been written in a body axis system yielding a 6-DOF model. It was found during flight tests that vehicle conducted coordinated turns with no appreciable adverse yaw. Since FWMAV was not designed with a vertical stabilizer and rudder control surface, directional stability was therefore augmented through winglets and high wing leading edge sweep. Major problems encountered during flight tests were related to left rolling tendency. The left roll tendency was found inherent to clockwise rotating propeller as 'P' factor, gyroscopic precession, torque effect and spiraling slipstream. To achieve successful flights, many actions were required including removal of excessive play from elevon control rods, active actuation of control surfaces, enhanced launch speed during take off, and increased throttle control during initial phase of flight. FWMAV flew many successful stable flights in which intended mission profile was accomplished, thereby validating the proposed airfoil selection procedure, modeling technique and proposed design.},

In this paper, the procedure of computing the aerodynamic parameters is developed. All the longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic derivatives are firstly calculated through semi-empirical method based on the aerodynamics, rather than the wind tunnel tests or fluid dynamics software analysis. Secondly, the residuals of each derivative are proposed to be identified or estimated further via Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), with the observations of the attitude and velocity from the airborne integrated navigation system. Meanwhile, the observability of the targeted parameters is analyzed and strengthened through multiple maneuvers. Based on a small-scaled fixed-wing aircraft driven by propeller, the airborne sensors are chosen and the model of the actuators are constructed. Then, real flight tests are implemented to verify the calculation and identification process. Test results tell the rationality of the semi-empirical method and show the improvement of accuracy of ADM after the compensation of the parameters.},

   abstract = {Fixed wing micro air vehicles (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging due to the low Reynolds number regime (104-105) they operate in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10-15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, and the range of stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with geometric twist (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed. Multi-objective optimization aimed at improving lift, drag, and pitching moment considerations is also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Among these are: advanced modeling and simulation models for MAVs, aero-structural interaction, advanced guidance techniques, digital simulations, and vehicle integration. In order to optimize collaboration within AFRL and also with outside research organizations, it was decided that a common MAV configuration be designed that would serve as a reference for current and future research. This paper describes a generic micro air vehicle that will serve as a "baseline" configuration. The MAV design incorporates a circular fuselage, a thin cambered wing, and a conventional tail. The MAV has a wingspan of 24 inches and a fuselage length of 17 inches. This paper will also detail the rational behind the design as well as provide initial aerodynamic properties and flight performance characteristics of the AFRL Generic MAV, herein called "GENMAV.".},

Micro aerial vehicles are very small, have a wingspan of about 100-150 mm, and operate at relatively low Reynolds numbers. A precision aerodynamic balance was designed in order to measure the lift, drag, rolling-moment, and pitching-moment of micro air vehicles, as these parameters are too small to be determined by general-purpose aerodynamic measurement systems. During the design process, the aerodynamic balance was analyzed with the finite-element method in order to produce an optimal design and was calibrated as well. The calibration results and the finite element analysis results were compared and found to be in good agreement and the final design was determined to be acceptable. In addition, a computer-based data acquisition system has been developed to acquire measurement data from the aerodynamic balance. Wind tunnel tests of a 2D airfoil were performed to validate the aerodynamic measurement system. Results of the wind tunnel tests were compared with references and found to be in good agreement. Finally, we measured aerodynamic characteristics of MAV wing model used in Batwing with the developed aerodynamic measurement system. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

The airplanes have wingspans ranging from approximately 9 to 15 in and fly at Reynolds numbers below 25,000. The motion track provided a time history of the position and attitude and was used to derive the aerodynamic moments and analyze the stability derivatives of the airplanes. A reconfigurable hand-launched glider was used to show results for different wing configurations. In addition to the glider, a small commercially manufactured SU-26xp airplane was used. The longitudinal stability measurements from experimental data showed both airplanes to be more stable than predictions based on geometry. The SU-26xp airplane was used to study the effects of elevator deflection on trim flight conditions. In addition, the lateral stability terms for both airplane were measured. By understanding the stability and control over a range of flight conditions, a better understanding of the control of micro UAVs can be developed. © 2011 by Daniel V. Uhlig and Michael S. Selig.},

   abstract = {A computational study has been conducted on various airfoils to simulate flows at Reynolds numbers (Re) primarily between 104 and 105 to provide understanding and guidance for MAV and other low-Reynolds-number designs. The computational fluid dynamics tool used in this study is a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and a correlation-based laminar–turbulent boundary-layer transition model. The airfoils investigated in this study include NACA 0009, NACA 0012 (conventional and reversed configuration), Clark-Y, flat plate airfoils (1, 3, and 5% thickness), and thin cambered plates (3, 6, and 9% camber). Airfoils were examined for lift and drag performance as well as surface pressure and flow field characteristics. In general, it is observed that below the Reynolds number of 106, lift and drag characteristics for most airfoils cannot be assumed to be constant with the Reynolds number. Below the Reynolds number of 105, cambered plate airfoils are shown to have better lift and drag characteristics than thick conventional airfoils with rounded-leading edges. Flat plate performance is generally invariant to the Reynolds number, but performance improves as thickness is decreased for a given Reynolds number.},

   abstract = {Morphing wings comprised of fixed leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces have emerged as a novel active control technique for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the wake dynamics and aerodynamic performance of such hybrid airfoil configuration has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional flows over hybrid airfoils comprised of NACA 0012 leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces are performed at a fixed Reynolds number of 1000. The effects of length and camber of the trailing control surface on the laminar aerodynamic characteristics are studied over a wide range of angle of attack. It is shown that the flow behind the airfoil exhibits different features, including steady flow, periodic vortex shedding, and quasi-periodic vortex shedding for different configurations. The transition between these wake states occurs at slightly smaller angles of attack compared to the nominal NACA 0012 airfoil. While the drag coefficient remains close to each other at a fixed angle of attack, the lift coefficient of the hybrid airfoil is positively affected by the length and camber of the trailing control surface. The mechanism of lift generation is examined by surface pressure distributions and a force element analysis. It is revealed that with increased camber of the trailing control surface, the flow on both the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil are modified in a beneficial way to enhance lift. Increasing the length ratio only significantly modifies the flow near the aft section on the pressure side. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic characterization of hybrid airfoils with trailing control surfaces, and could potentially aid the design of control techniques for next-generation small unmanned aerial vehicles.},

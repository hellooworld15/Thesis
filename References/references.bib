It maximizes the autonomous combat capability of UAVs and the control capability of MAVs. Furthermore, it improves the comprehensive combat effectiveness. The quantitative description of intercommunication in different aircrafts along with the evaluation of the collaborative combat capability is an emphasis in military research. This paper analyzes the collaborative combat process. Node and edge models are established in the MAV/UAV collaborative network. The intercommunication and combat behaviors among combat entities are analyzed. Based on the information entropy, the effect of capability uncertainties on the collaborative combat is described quantitatively. An evaluation method of the MAV/UAV collaborative combat capability is proposed. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the proposed model and evaluation method that prove its feasibility and effectiveness.},

First, a multi-objective optimization model of planning UAV route for road segment surveillance was proposed, which aimed to minimize UAV cruise distance and minimize the number of UAVs used. Then, an evolutionary algorithm based on Pareto optimality technique was proposed to solve multi-objective UAV route planning problem. At last, a UAV flight experiment was conducted to test UAV route planning effect, and a case with three scenarios was studied to analyze the impact of different road segment lengths on UAV route planning. The case results show that the optimized cruise distance and the number of UAVs used decrease by an average of 38.43\% and 33.33%, respectively. Additionally, shortening or extending the length of road segments has different impacts on UAV route planning.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of propeller-induced flow effects on the dynamics of a fixed wing biplane micro air vehicle. The analysis is based on wind tunnel tests and mathematical modeling. This analysis plays a pivotal role because the propeller-induced flow has significant effects on the dynamics of fixed wing micro air vehicle due to submergence of a large portion of the wing in propeller slipstream. Although the effect of the propeller-induced flow on the various aerodynamic parameter is reported in the literature; however, its effects on overall forces, moments and vehicle dynamics are not quantified so far. In this paper, propeller-induced flow effects are modeled as a function of motor rotation speed and mathematical analysis is performed to quantify their effects. The wind tunnel test is conducted at different propeller speeds on a biplane micro air vehicle “Skylark”, having wingspan and chord length of 150 mm and 140 mm, respectively. Analysis of results shows that the propeller slipstream increases the overall lift, drag, side force, range, and endurance significantly. Propeller flow also contributes to the rolling moment and the pitching moment, while it has negligible effects on the yawing moment. It is shown that the trim angle of attack is lower when the propeller flow is considered in computing the trim conditions.},

Micro aerial vehicles are very small, have a wingspan of about 100-150 mm, and operate at relatively low Reynolds numbers. A precision aerodynamic balance was designed in order to measure the lift, drag, rolling-moment, and pitching-moment of micro air vehicles, as these parameters are too small to be determined by general-purpose aerodynamic measurement systems. During the design process, the aerodynamic balance was analyzed with the finite-element method in order to produce an optimal design and was calibrated as well. The calibration results and the finite element analysis results were compared and found to be in good agreement and the final design was determined to be acceptable. In addition, a computer-based data acquisition system has been developed to acquire measurement data from the aerodynamic balance. Wind tunnel tests of a 2D airfoil were performed to validate the aerodynamic measurement system. Results of the wind tunnel tests were compared with references and found to be in good agreement. Finally, we measured aerodynamic characteristics of MAV wing model used in Batwing with the developed aerodynamic measurement system. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

As aerospace systems require greater precision, the ability to account for small disturbances and errors becomes more important. Monte Carlo simulation has been the traditional method for analyzing a design in the presence of uncertainty, but the incredible computational cost of both a Monte Carlo simulation and CFD make it incredibly time-consuming to find the full range of responses of an uncertain system. This paper demonstrates a method for using wind tunnel testing and a statistical description of turbulence characteristics to efficiently analyze the open loop dynamics of a micro air vehicle. Micro air vehicles are of special interest both because their mission effectiveness is more sensitive to turbulence and they experience greater turbulent fluctuations in their flight regime than larger faster vehicles. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

A custom three-component force balance for measuring lift, drag, and moment is described in detail and validated. Both straight and tapered wings were wind tunnel tested, and flow visualization was performed to characterize the flow. The measurements showed that all wings exhibited sensitivity to changes in aspect ratio and Reynolds number. Oswald's efficiency factors derived from the measurements ranged from a low value of 0.3 to more typical values near 0.8. Additionally, the aerodynamic performance trends relating to the maximum lift coefficient, lift curve slope, and aerodynamic center are computed from the measurements and discussed for the flat-plate wing models. Finally, no hysteresis in angle of attack was observed over the range of Reynolds numbers tested.},

This study's primary objective is to present the effect of the interactions between a low aspect ratio wing and propeller for a range of incidence in transition between horizontal and vertical flight. During the transition from horizontal flight to vertical flight or vice versa, the flow patterns seen by the wing are the result of the combination between the free-stream and the propeller flow. This was reflected in the change of the aerodynamic forces and moments of the wing. The model is a tractor configuration propeller and with a wing of aspect ratio equal to one, the airfoil of the wing is a NACA 0012. All tests were conducted at low speeds in a range from 2 to 8 m/s. In order to simulate the transition flight of a tilt-body MAV VTOL a range of incidence from-10 to 90 degrees was used. The results show that the flow of the propeller certainly improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, increasing the lift and delaying stall with respect to the flight path of the MAV.},

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear coupled longitudinal and lateral state space model are compared with and without propeller flow effects. The variation in the natural frequencies and damping ratios of short period mode, phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode are analyzed for various trim airspeed. An increase in the natural frequency is observed for phugoid mode and Dutch roll mode with propeller effects. The stability of the spiral mode is enhanced by the propeller flow and also the response of the roll subsidence mode is faster with propeller effects. Detailed analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors shows the importance of incorporating propeller flow in analyzing the dynamics of the MAV.},

The selection procedure of airfoil has been developed by considering parameters related to aerodynamic efficiency and flight stability. Airfoil aerodynamic parameters have been calculated using a potential flow solver for ten candidate airfoils. Eppler-387 proved to be the most efficient reflexed airfoil and therefore was selected for fabrication and further flight testing of vehicle. Elevon control surfaces have been designed and evaluated for longitudinal and lateral control. The vehicle was fabricated using hot wire machine with EPP styrofoam of density 50 Kg/m3. Static aerodynamic coefficients were evaluated using wind tunnel tests conducted at cruise velocity of 20 m/s for varying angles of attack. Rate derivatives and elevon control derivatives have also been calculated. Equations of motion for FWMAV have been written in a body axis system yielding a 6-DOF model. It was found during flight tests that vehicle conducted coordinated turns with no appreciable adverse yaw. Since FWMAV was not designed with a vertical stabilizer and rudder control surface, directional stability was therefore augmented through winglets and high wing leading edge sweep. Major problems encountered during flight tests were related to left rolling tendency. The left roll tendency was found inherent to clockwise rotating propeller as 'P' factor, gyroscopic precession, torque effect and spiraling slipstream. To achieve successful flights, many actions were required including removal of excessive play from elevon control rods, active actuation of control surfaces, enhanced launch speed during take off, and increased throttle control during initial phase of flight. FWMAV flew many successful stable flights in which intended mission profile was accomplished, thereby validating the proposed airfoil selection procedure, modeling technique and proposed design.},

   abstract = {In this research effect of propeller induced flow on aerodynamic characteristics of low aspect ratio flying wing micro aerial vehicle has been investigated experimentally in subsonic wind tunnel. Left turning tendencies of right-handed propellers have been discussed in literature, but not much work has been done to quantify them. In this research, we have quantified these tendencies as a change in aerodynamic coefficient with a change in advance ratio at a longitudinal trim angle of attack using subsonic wind tunnel. For experimental testing, three fixed pitch propeller diameters (5 inch, 6 inch and 7 inch), three propeller rotational speeds (7800, 10800 and 12300 RPMs) and three wind tunnel speeds (10, 15 and 20 m/s) have been considered to form up 27 advance ratios. Additionally, wind tunnel tests of 9 wind mill cases were conducted and considered as baseline. Experimental uncertainty assessment for measurement of forces and moments was carried out before conduct of wind tunnel tests. Large variation in lift, drag, yawing moment and rolling moment was captured at low advance ratios, which indicated their significance at high propeller rotational speeds and large propeller diameters. Side force and pitching moment did not reflect any significant change. LD at trim point was found a nonlinear function of propeller diameter to wingspan ratio Db , and propeller rotational speed. Rate and control derivatives were obtained using unsteady vortex lattice method with propeller induced flow effect modeled by Helical Vortex Modeling approach. In this research, we have proposed improved 6-DOF equations of motion, with a contribution of advance ratio J. It is concluded, that propeller induced flow effects have a significant contribution in flight dynamic modeling for vehicles with large propeller diameter to wingspan ratio, Db of 22% or more.},

   abstract = {An experimental study of a rotatable tail mechanism applied to a small unmanned aerial vehicle was performed using a six-component wind-tunnel balance in the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology low-speed wind tunnel. Attributes of the control and stability characteristics of the original vehicle, which were documented in an earlier study, are compared with those of a unique control methodology, a tall consisting of a single surface, with controllable elevation and rotation. An advantage of this change is a reduction in the storage length of the vehicle. Because there are similarities in the rotatable tail mechanism and the tail of many birds, the rotatable tail reflects a biomimetric feature. Measured force and moment coefficient measurements for the actual vehicle at a typical flight speed indicated that a rotatable tail provides a suffident yaw moment for turning. For example, yaw moment coefficients Cn, ranging from -0.02 to +0.02, which is typical tor a rudder, were achievable as long as the absolute value of the tall elevation angle was large. The dependence of the yaw moment coefficient on the elevator angle and angle of attack, in addition to the tail rotation angle, indicates that there would be significant chalenges in applying a robust flight control scheme with the current actuator configuration. An additional feature of the tail design is that by deflecting the tail upward, it could also function effectively as an air brake. A more than twofold increase in drag coefficient for constant angle of attack was measured when the tail elevation angle was increased to nearly 70 deg.},

The wing on this 24″ span, 6″ chord MAV consists of a flexible parachute material attached to a rigid carbon-fiber skeleton, and deforms considerably under aerodynamic loading. The effect this flexible structure has on aerodynamic performance characteristics was assessed in wind tunnel tests at the Air Force Institute of Technology. Forces and moments were measured for the flexible wing MAV and a rigid wing counterpart, enabling the isolation of the effect of flexure. Measurements indicated that increased wing flexure delayed stall and increased the maximum value of L/D by approximately 20 to 30 percent for airspeeds ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour. The flexible wing MAV displayed static stability in all three principal control axes. The vehicle's response to control surface deflection was also measured. These deflections resulted in predictable and consistent performance between-10° and +10° deflection. Responses declined steadily after ±10°, and in some circumstances, showed slope sign reversal, evidently due to separation effects. Preliminary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and XFOIL predictions are presented for the 2-D rigid wing and compared to experimental data.},

   abstract = {A motion tracking system was used to experimentally determine the aerodynamic forces and moments of two micro UAVs. The airplanes have wingspans ranging from approximately 9 to 15 in and fly at Reynolds numbers below 25,000. The motion track provided a time history of the position and attitude and was used to derive the aerodynamic moments and analyze the stability derivatives of the airplanes. A reconfigurable hand-launched glider was used to show results for different wing configurations. In addition to the glider, a small commercially manufactured SU-26xp airplane was used. The longitudinal stability measurements from experimental data showed both airplanes to be more stable than predictions based on geometry. The SU-26xp airplane was used to study the effects of elevator deflection on trim flight conditions. In addition, the lateral stability terms for both airplane were measured. By understanding the stability and control over a range of flight conditions, a better understanding of the control of micro UAVs can be developed. © 2011 by Daniel V. Uhlig and Michael S. Selig.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of propeller-induced flow effects on the dynamics of a fixed wing biplane micro air vehicle. The analysis is based on wind tunnel tests and mathematical modeling. This analysis plays a pivotal role because the propeller-induced flow has significant effects on the dynamics of fixed wing micro air vehicle due to submergence of a large portion of the wing in propeller slipstream. Although the effect of the propeller-induced flow on the various aerodynamic parameter is reported in the literature; however, its effects on overall forces, moments and vehicle dynamics are not quantified so far. In this paper, propeller-induced flow effects are modeled as a function of motor rotation speed and mathematical analysis is performed to quantify their effects. The wind tunnel test is conducted at different propeller speeds on a biplane micro air vehicle “Skylark”, having wingspan and chord length of 150 mm and 140 mm, respectively. Analysis of results shows that the propeller slipstream increases the overall lift, drag, side force, range, and endurance significantly. Propeller flow also contributes to the rolling moment and the pitching moment, while it has negligible effects on the yawing moment. It is shown that the trim angle of attack is lower when the propeller flow is considered in computing the trim conditions.},

% Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are a class of unmanned aerial vehicles that are much smaller in size. These small aircraft allow for the observation of hazardous environments which are inaccessible to ground vehicles. Due to their small size theey are much more difficult to design and manufacture. The additional complexity is due to several main factors including: low speed flight, small physical dimensions, structural strength, reduced stall speed and low inertia. With MAV design becoming one of the fastest-growing areas of development in the aerospace industry, there is an increasing need to have accurate experimental data to validate, simulate and model varieties of MAV configurations. One of the core but currently missing investigations is into the influence of effect of propellers on the aerodynamics and stability of MAV's

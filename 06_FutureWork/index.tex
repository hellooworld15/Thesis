\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work} 
This chapter outlines the work completed in this thesis and summarises the main conclusions. Key areas identified for further investigation have also been identified with suggestions made on areas which could provide key insights into this area of study. 
\section{Conclusions}


The key conclusions determined from this investigation are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}


\section{Future Work}
The conclusions made in this thesis leads to many further investigations which would greatly improve our understanding of \acrshort{MAV} stability and propeller-wing interactions in low airspeed condiitons. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An analysis into the effects of wing sweep in both the \acrshort{MAV} tractor and pusher configurations. Currently only one wing shape has been analysed and the influence of the wing shape on the stability of the MAV would enable a greater understanding of the effects 

    \item An analysis of wing mounted propellers

    \item Effects of larger propeller size

    \item Further refinement of the VAP model geometry to better account for fuselage, tail and wing shapes

    \item 

    
\end{itemize}

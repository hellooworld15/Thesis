\vspace{-3em}
I, Jasmine Warner, hereby declare that this thesis submission titled \emph{Aerodynamic Characteristics of a Generic Micro-Aerial Vehicle with and without Propeller Interactions} is my own work and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it contains no material previously published or written by another person nor material which to a substantial extent has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma of the University or other institute of higher learning, except where due acknowledgement has been made in the text.  Specifically, the work I contributed consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conducting the literature review
    \item Producing a 3D model of the generic micro aerial vechicle
    \item Wind tunnel testing of the generic micro aerial vechicle model
    \item Analysing data of wind tunnel results; and
    \item Writing this thesis report.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{declaration}
\vspace{-3em}
I, Victor Kuo, hereby declare that this thesis submission titled \emph{Modern Security Compliance with Zero-Knowledge Proofs} is my own work and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it contains no material previously published or written by another person nor material which to a substantial extent has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma of the University or other institute of higher learning, except where due acknowledgement has been made in the text.  Specifically, the work I contributed consists of:

\vspace{-1em}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conducting the literature review;
    \item Analysing and hypothesising solutions to \acrlong{zk} compliance issues. 
    \item Defining the requirements of \gls{ProveIt};
    \item Developing \gls{ProveIt}, a complete end-to-end \acrshort{zksnark} application to generate and verify computational proofs for sanitization purposes;
    \item Developing a generic, high level string library for arithmetic circuits for use in \acrshortpl{zksnark};
    \item Contributing the algorithm for \code{Compare()} to the open-source project \gls{gnark};
    \item Conducting the analysis of runtimes and memory usage for \gls{ProveIt}, and asserting the feasibility and viability of using \acrshortpl{zksnark} in industry for security compliance requirements; and
    \item Writing this thesis report.
\end{enumerate}

Assistance was received from my supervisors in the areas of:

\vspace{-1em}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identifying \acrshortpl{zksnark} as a viable solution to the problem;
    \item Identifying relevant literature to this thesis; and
    \item Improving this thesis through their feedback.
\end{enumerate}
